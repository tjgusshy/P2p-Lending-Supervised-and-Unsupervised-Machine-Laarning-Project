P2P Lending Risk Analysis & Investor DashboardProject OverviewThis repository contains an end-to-end machine learning pipeline designed to analyze Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending data. The project aims to classify borrower risk, calculate the Probability of Default (PD), and cluster borrowers to help investors optimize their portfolios. The final output is visualized in an interactive Investor Dashboard

DescriptionStatusp2p_machine_learning_model.ipynbCore Analysis: Jupyter Notebook containing data preprocessing, EDA, and the training logic for the risk models. It generates the clusters and PD metrics.

✅ Final Code investor_dashboard.pyApplication: The Python script for the interactive dashboard ( Streamlit ) that allows investors to explore loan segments and risk profiles.
🔄 Recently Updatedborrower_clusters_with_pd.csvProcessed

Data: The output dataset containing borrower segments (clusters) and their calculated Probability of Default (PD).
📄 Dataloans_full_schema.csvRaw Data: The original dataset containing the full schema of historical loan information used for training.
📄 Data methodology_figures/Assets: A directory containing generated plots, confusion matrices, and figures documenting the methodology.

📂 Folder uv.lock 
Dependency Lock: Lock file generated by the uv package manager to ensure reproducible builds.
🔒 System requirements.txt

Dependencies: Standard Python package requirements for the environment.
⚙️ ConfigMethodologyData Ingestion: Raw loan data is loaded from loans_full_schema.csv.Machine Learning:The p2p_machine_learning_model.ipynb notebook handles feature engineering and trains a classification model.It calculates the Probability of Default (PD) for each loan.It applies clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means) to group borrowers with similar risk/return profiles.Visualization: The results are exported to borrower_clusters_with_pd.csv and visualized via investor_dashboard.py.Installation & SetupThis project uses uv for dependency management, but also provides a standard requirements.txt.Option A: Using uv (Recommended)If you have uv installed, you can sync the environment directly using the lock file:Bashuv sync
Option B: Standard pipBashpip install -r requirements.txt
Usage 

1. Running the Analysis To retrain models or regenerate figures, open the Jupyter Notebook:Bash jupyter notebook p2p_machine_learning_model.ipynb
